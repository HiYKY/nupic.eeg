# Using Numenta's Hierachical Temporal Memory algorithm to classify EEG data
*NB: EEG is the recording of electrical activity along the scalp - in other words, brainwaves :-)*

## Motor Imagery Classification
* `motor_imagery` contains the code for EEG motor imagery classification.
* EGG data was recorded around the motor cortex. Setup:
1. Signal recorded with a 8 channels EEG and [OpenBCI](www.openBCI.com) board.
2. Three phases: no movement, left hand, right hand.
3. Sampling rate: 4 ms.
* This classifier was made at the Numenta Hackathon (NuPIC Fall 2014 Hackathon) where I gave a little demo.
* See **[demo slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wFWSk4P3yHDkPzV19Q0sZYX9NhwvEBLJQQXKh0eyZws/edit?usp=sharing)** and **[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEh48KOmkIA)**.
